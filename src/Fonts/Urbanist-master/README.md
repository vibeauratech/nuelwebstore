Urbanist is a low-contrast, geometric sans-serif inspired by Modernist design and typography. The project was launched by Corey Hu in 2020 with 9 weights and accompanying italics. Conceived from elementary shapes, Urbanist's neutrality makes it a versatile display font for print and digital mediums. The font is currently available as a variable font with "Weight" and "Italic" axes.

## Build from source

To build fonts, use the provided build script:

```
cd ./sources
bash build.sh
```

Fonts will be built in `./fonts/`.

If you're unable to run the build script, glyphsLib currently doesn't support Glyphs3 .glyphs files. You can try using [this glyphsLib fork](https://github.com/simoncozens/glyphsLib/tree/glyphs3-try3) instead.
